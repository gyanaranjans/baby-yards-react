                        <h1>Conditions for Refunds</h1>
                        <p>In order for you as a customer to be eligible for a refund, please make sure that:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>The servieces were purchased in the last 14 days</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>The following states that the refund cannot be initiated:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>The service provided by us was flawless if proved.</li>
                            <li>Baby-yards does not acknowledge any payments made directly to the tutor without our consent/approval/authorization.</li>
                            <li>The Tutor (if) dealt with the third-party without acknowledgement of Baby-yards causes violation of T&C of Baby-yards.</li>
                            <li>Taking payment from the THIRD-PARTY directly without Baby-yards's approval / consent / authorization.</li>
                            <li>For the Violation of terms of servieces, agreements making the contract NULL and VOID.</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>We reserve the right to refuse returns of any kind that does not meet the above return
                            conditions in our sole discretion.</p>
                        <p>Only regularly priced Orders may be refunded. Unfortunately, Customized Orders on discounted price cannot be refunded.
                            This exclusion may not apply to You if it is not permitted by applicable law.</p>
                        <h1>Partial Refunds</h1>
                        <p>The Customer may get partial refunds if servieces provided by Baby-yards remain incomplete. Or the Third-Party(Tutor) appointed didn't complete his/her tenure due to uncertain circumstances.</p>
                        <p>The Customer must Acknowledge Baby-yards Terms &amp; Conditions.</p>
                        <p>We cannot be held responsible for incomplete tenure by the Tutor. Therefore, We
                            will try to compensate the Customer by providing a substitute teacher at the same rate as the previous one or by paying partial refund.</p>
                        <h1>Extra Classes</h1>
                        <p>Extra classes are charged different from regular ones, thereby the Customer has to pay for all Extra classes. If not paid, refuse to pay, the services for the particular customer will be suspended until dues are cleared.</p>
                        <p>If the Customer deals with the third-party under the table, they will be barred from Baby-yards servieces forever.</p>
