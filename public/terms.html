            court in any such action or proceeding. The United Nations Convention on Contracts for the International

            to Baby-yards.
          </p>
          <p>

            and the remaining portions shall remain in full force and effect.
          </p>
          <p>
            The failure of Baby-yards to exercise or enforce any right or provision of the Terms shall not constitute a
            waiver of such right or provision.
          </p>
          <p>
            Baby-yards shall not be liable for failing or delaying performance of its obligations resulting from any
